### Quick Start

There are several methods to include Formare into your project:

1. Use **CDN** provided by jsDelivr
2. Use **package managers**
3. **Download our source code** directly

##### Content Delivery Network (CDN)

The quickest way you can integrate Formare into your project is through CDN provided by jsDelivr.
Put it inside a `<link>` tag in your project's `<head>` like so:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```html
<head>
  ...
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/formare/css/formare.css" /> <!-- highlight-line -->
</head>
```

##### Package Managers

`npm` or `yarn` can also be used to install Formare if you prefer using package managers instead.

```shell
$ npm install formare
```

```shell
$ yarn add formare
```

##### Manual Installation

If you prefer the traditional way of installing a package, you can download our source directly from our repository and
manually include it into your project.

### Requirements

Formare is a **modern** CSS framework which is highly suited for modern web development with HTML5 and responsiveness in mind.
To make sure everything works correctly, we highly recommend that you include all these requirements below prior or after installing Formare:

##### Declare `<!DOCTYPE html>`

`<!DOCTYPE html>` is required to make sure your browser runs in HTML5 mode which will enable modern HTML tags like `<header>`, `<footer>`,
or `<section>` and to make sure they work nicely without any noticeable setbacks.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```html
<!DOCTYPE html> <!-- highlight-line --> 
<html>
  <head>
  ...
```

##### Set responsive meta tag

Formare is made for _mobile first_ web development.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```html
<head>
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" /> <!-- highlight-line -->
  ...
</head>
```
