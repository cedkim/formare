#### Headings

All HTML headings from `<h1>` to `<h6>` are available. We used the **Perfect Fourth** preset from
[typescale.com](typescale.com) as the base headings which you customize to your liking.

You can also use the class variants `.Heading-1` through `.Heading-6` classes in cases you cannot use the
associated heading HTML tag.
