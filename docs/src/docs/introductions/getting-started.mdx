---

#### Introduction

Formare combines implementations, techniques and approaches from different design systems, popular frameworks or
libraries. We do this so you can have the best from many worlds and both beginner and advanced developers alike
can easily implement web interfaces without much hassle.

Our main focus is to make a fully flexible and customizable framework so you can construct your own UI and theme
library to express your personal brand or company more freely.

#### Installation

There are multiple methods you can use to install Formare into your project, but the most recommended ones are:

1. Use the **CDN** provided by jsDelivr
2. Use **package managers** via NPM or Yarn

###### Content Delivery Network (CDN)

Using our CDN hosted by jsDelivr is probably the quickest way you can do to integrate Formare into your project.
If you're a beginner or just starting out in web development, we recommend you to use this method instead of the advanced ones below.
Put this `<link>` tag in your project's `<head>`, like this:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```html
<head>
  ...
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/formare/css/formare.css" /> <!-- highlight-line -->
</head>
```

###### Package Managers

If you're more familiar with package managers, you can use that instead for a better integration with popular
web frameworks.

```bash
$ npm install formare
$ yarn add formare
```
