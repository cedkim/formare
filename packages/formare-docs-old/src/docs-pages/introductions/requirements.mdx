## Introduction

Formare is a **modern** CSS framework which is highly suited for modern web development with HTML5; the
latest standard for web development. To make sure everything works correctly, we highly recommend that
you do these checklists below after adding Formare:

#### Declare `<!DOCTYPE html>`

`<!DOCTYPE html>` is required to make sure your browser runs in HTML5 mode which will enable modern HTML
tags like `<header>`, `<footer>`, or `<section>` and to make sure they work nicely without any noticeable setbacks.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```html
<!DOCTYPE html> 
<html>
  <head>
  ...
```

#### Set Responsive Meta Tag

Formare is made for _mobile-first_ web development. We highly recommend you to put this tag inside your project
so Formare can scale properly on mobile devices.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```html
<head>
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
  ...
</head>
```
